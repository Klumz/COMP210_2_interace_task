# COMP210_2_interace_task (WIP)

I will be basing my VR game on our group project, which is a top down dungeon crawler. I will change the game accordingly to fit VR, and will be played by using VR controllers as opposed to joysticks. However, the game itself is heavily melee-focused so I will be trying a different approach in order to integrate this with VR. 

For the controls, one controller will be used to move the player and the other to attack.
