My game is a first-person shooter where you shoot and kill slowly approaching enemies towards you with your gun. The physical part to shoot the gun in-game with will be a button attached to a glove (right hand) between the thumb and index finger, forcing the user to shape and simulate their hand like a gun. The board will be attached on the same glove but behind it. The goal of the game is to get as many points as you can while avoiding death, which is caused when one of the approaching enemies touch you. 

#### Rough example

### Market Research

From my market research, I have not found any VR gadgets out there with similar functionality. Although I have found fairly similar gloves such as the [CyberTouch glove](http://www.cyberglovesystems.com/cybertouch/) and the classic [Power Glove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove) by Nintendo. However they are not exactly what I had in mind. [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com/) is also a similar game in the sense that you kill slowly approaching enemies (but without the time stops).

### User Stories:

As a player, I want score
Adding a score at the end of the game showing how many enemies have been killed can improve replayability and encourage players to challenge each other (1 enemy killed = 1 point)

As a player, I would like to have good aiming accuracy
The glove itself will have to be accurate in accordance with the gun in-game

As a player, I would like the gameplay to be fairly fast faced
Although the enemies themselves aren't very quick, I will have to keep turning and shooting to avoid getting surrounded (they spawn around the player) 

As a player, I want distinctive audio
Audio plays a notable part as I will need to hear when an enemy is getting closer in order to realise which one to prioritise
